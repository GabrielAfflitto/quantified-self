# Quantified Self Frontend

  Quantified Self is a food posting and calorie tracking cross platform application, composed of decoupled frontend and backend. The frontend is built in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. The backend is built in Node.js and Express.js. In this application, a user can store foods along with the amount of calories and add them to meals to track their total calorie count for meals as well as individual foods. This is the frontend portion of the application.
